                            Prerequisites

The KiekMolWedderIn tournamnent web application has been developed and tested with
- PHP 7.1.9
- MySQL 5.7.19
- Apache httpd 2.4.27
- Mozilla Firefox 57.0.3 (64 Bit)
- Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.18837
- Windows 7 Enterprise Edition 64 bit (all aforemnetioned applications running on one box)

The application should work on any LAMP stack with PHP 7. 


                            Unpacking the files

Create a new directory on your web server (we call this the ROOT_DIR in the following). Unpack under 
ROOT_DIR the files and sub-directories of the application. Ensure that the UTF-8 encoding of the files is 
not preserved. 


                            Preparing the database

You need to get access to an empty MySQL database schema with the permission to create new database tables. 
Connect with a MySQL client (e.g. MySQL Workbench or MySQL command line) to the empty database and execute
the scripts (*.sql) located under ROOT_DIR/installation/database_scripts. It does not matter in which sequence 
you apply the database scripts.


                            Configurimg the database connection
Open with a text editor the file ROOT_DIR/db/database.php and replace in lines 49 - 53 the entries for 
dbHost (IP address or host name of your database server), dbName (name of your database schema), 
dbUser (user to connect to the database), dbPassword (password for your database), dbPort (port of your database) 
with the data for your database

        $this->dbHost = '127.0.0.1';
        $this->dbName = 'kiekmolwedderin';
        $this->dbUser = 'hanns';
        $this->dbPassword = 'hanns';
        $this->dbPort = 3306;

In a hosting environment you will get the aforementioned data from your hosting provider. 
Be sure to keep the single quotes ' ' for the first four entries and save the file with UTF-8 encoding. 


                            Preparing the web server
Register ROOT_DIR with your web server as the default directory for the application and the file 
ROOT_DIR/index.php as the default file. Start the web server so that you can access the application with 
a Web browser. 


                            Creating the initial user account
It is assumed that your web server is running and that you can reach the KiekMolWedderIn web application 
via BASE_URL/index.php (the value of BASE_URL depends on the configuration of your web server).
Enter the URL BASE_URL/player_create_initial.php into your browser. Fill in all data in the player 
registration form and ensure to select Administrator for the player role. After saving you can log in 
with the new user account. Please note that the access via BASE_URL/player_create_initial.php will 
only work for an empty database. You can now log in with the new user account; the online help gives you 
further instructions how to use the application.
